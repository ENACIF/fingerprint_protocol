# Fingerprint biometric analysis protocol: assessing repeatability, accuracy, and stability in Mexican population

# ABSTRACT

Proposal of a protocol that was tested to cover its repeatability, accuracy, and stability for determining the associated error and to ensure its usability; evaluated by Observed Agreement (Agreement Percentage) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) to demonstrate the repeatability by intra-observers and inter-observers, among different levels of training. Thereafter the stability was evaluated through consistency of intra-observer repeatability after time. Those aspects of a fingerprint protocol have not been reported before.

The proposed protocol describes the procedure, step by step, for obtaining the population data information through fingerprints by encompassing different types of samples as rolled, plain, printed and biometric registers in a way to minimize error and ensure to obtain consistent results and, at the same time, explore the use of rolled biometric fingerprint samples to describe the Mexican population by determining the frequency of pattern types and the occurrence of the type of minutiae associated with sex, phalanx and pattern type.
